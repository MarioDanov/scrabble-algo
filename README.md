# Scrabble Word Reduction Validator

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

This Java program processes Scrabble words to find valid words that can be formed by successively removing one letter from longer words, starting with single-letter words "I" and "A". The solution uses recursive filtering to validate words of different lengths up to 9 characters.

## Features
- Loads words from a remote text file
- Filters words recursively based on reducibility
- Handles words up to 9 characters long
- Measures execution time
- Counts valid words at each length level

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/MarioDanov/scrabble-algo.git

## How It Works

### Loading Words
- **Fetches words** from a GitHub-hosted text file
- **Filters words** to include only those containing 'A' or 'I'
- **Groups words** by their length using a dictionary/map

### Base Cases
- **Pre-populates valid 1-letter words**: "A" and "I"
- **Uses 2-letter words** as the foundation for recursive filtering

### Recursive Filtering
For each word length (3-9):
1. **Generates variations**: Creates all possible single-character deletions
2. **Validation check**: Verifies if any variation matches a valid shorter word
3. **Retention logic**: Keeps words that can be reduced to valid shorter forms

### Output
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Execution time**: Measures total processing duration
- üìä **Word count**: Displays total valid words across all lengths

## Code Structure
- `main()`: Orchestrates loading, processing, and output
- `loadAllWords()`: Manages HTTP connection and data ingestion
- `filterWordsRecursively()`: Controls recursive filtering flow
- `getStrings()`: Implements core word reduction validation

## Example Output
```text
Time: 2.345; Number of words: 4321
```
